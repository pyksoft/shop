# Australian store

I created this project for my final assignment at Codaisseur's immersive training program.
The project combines and online shopping store with stripe checkout and payment.

## Basic useful feature list:


 * Adding items to a shopping cart via AJAX
 * Adding items to a wish list for later reference
 * Creating a profile for return visits
 * Checking out and order confirmation
 * Payment checkout via Stripe
 * Gems included: Rspec/Capybarra/selenium/byebug/factorygirl/faker/bootstrap/devise/Stripe/JQueryturbolinks
 * You can test the Stripe integration with fake creditcardnumber 4242 4242 4242 4242,
	any random CVS, expiry date and postal code
