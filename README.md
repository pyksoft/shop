# Australian store

I created this project for my final assignment at Codaisseurs immersive training program.
The project combines and online shopping store with stripe checkout and payment.

## Basic useful feature list:


 * Adding items to a shopping cart via AJAX
 * Adding items to a wish list for later reference
 * Creating a profile for return visits
 * Checking out and order confirmation
 * Payment checkout via Stripe
 * You can test the payment with fake creditcardnumber 4242 4242 4242 4242,
	any random CVS, expiry date and postal code
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files

### How to make it work
To use this project

1. clone it
2. run the migrations and seed the database
3. start the rails server.
